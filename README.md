# SurrealDB Example in Spring Boot Application

This is just an example on how you might use SurrealDB java driver in Spring Boot.
This is not what's going to look like in the near feature as I have a Spring Boot starter planned.

## Setup
- Import the driver JAR into the classpath.
You can refer to [this issue](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb.java/issues/2) for more info on how to do that.
FYI: it is already done in this example project. See build.gradle.

- Configure a bean for your SurrealDB driver. See the file named SurrealDbConfig.
